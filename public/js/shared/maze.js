// ---------------------------------------------------------------- pattern wolves (Skate only mode)
//
// In Skate only (mode 'ice') wolves don't wander: each runs a fixed route at a fixed rhythm (see the
// pattern section of enemies.js), so a leg is a "room" the kitty studies from the safe corner square and
// then skates through in one go (it can't stop on ice).
//
// Every wolf runs end to end and never stands still: it turns straight round at each end.
//   charger    runs the whole leg in a fixed lane, from the edge of one safe square to the next and back. Charger
//              lanes are skating lanes (PAT_LANES), so the lanes between them stay open; they own their lane all the time
//              (go beside them). A leg's charger lanes run at speeds whose laps share a period <= 60 s and take
//              turns; a lane holds 1-5 wolves, loosely spaced (more only where the level needs them for its count).
//   crosser    crosses the lane wall to wall, in rows walking shoulder to shoulder (crosswalk: line / wave / anti =
//              abreast, slightly staggered one way or the other / split = two halves from opposite walls; single)
//   diagonal   crosses wall to wall at an angle (swing, scissors = two crossing half a beat apart, fan = a row of swings)
// The final run (level 9's straight corridor) is built the same way: its rooms are legs too, with no door, and it
// has FINALE_WOLVES wolves.
// A leg = a set of charger lanes + crosser / diagonal segments top (entry, high th) to bottom. The room's beat is T:
// a crosser / diagonal runs there and back once per T. Rows are tight (PAT_ROW_SP < 2 * PAT_HIT: the kitty can't slip
// between two neighbours), so a row in step is a wall; it opens up through speed differences: in every row of 3+ at
// least one wolf in four (patRowNeed, more at random, spread along the row) drifts, lap T / (1 + j / n), n in
// PAT_DRIFT_N, j a whole number of laps gained / lost every n beats, picked so its speed is PAT_DRIFT_MU (0.8x - 1.4x)
// of the room's; lone crossers, pairs and scissors drift
// now and then. The room repeats every n * T <= PAT_DRIFT_PERIOD seconds. Rooms are built as designed, with no
// launch-window solver (the balance is playtested): each segment gets a random timing offset (placeLeg), about half
// of a room's rows starting the level nearer the other wall.
